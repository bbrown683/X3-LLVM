## Primitive Types
Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the language. For example, integers, floating point numbers, characters, and strings are all primitive types.

### Integer
An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero. Integers are commonly used for counting and indexing. 
Integers can have different sizes, which determines the range of values they can represent.
* `i8`: 8-bit signed integer, range from -128 to 127
* `i16`: 16-bit signed integer, range from -32,768 to 32,767
* `i32`: 32-bit signed integer, range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
* `i64`: 64-bit signed integer, range from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
* `u8`: 8-bit unsigned integer, range from 0 to 255
* `u16`: 16-bit unsigned integer, range from 0 to 65,535
* `u32`: 32-bit unsigned integer, range from 0 to 4,294,967,295
* `u64`: 64-bit unsigned integer, range from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615

### Floating Point
Floating point numbers are used to represent real numbers. They can represent a wide range of values, but have limited precision.
* `f32`: 32-bit floating point number, single precision
* `f64`: 64-bit floating point number, double precision

### Boolean
A boolean type represents a logical value, either `true` or `false`.

### Character
A character type represents a single Unicode character. Characters are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., `'a'`.
A character is defined by the `char` keyword.

### String
A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are enclosed in double quotes, e.g., `"hello"`.
Strings are represented by the `str` type.
